Removable Drives Applet (for the COSMIC™ Desktop)

An applet for the COSMIC™ desktop to manage your drives.

This is in very early stages but is functional as it stands.

### What we have

- List of all mounted drives (removable USB and internal drives mounted by the user)
- Click the drive to open the mount in COSMIC Files
- Click the unmount button to unmount the drive before removable
  
### Possible future additions

- Network mounts
- Possibly notifications for unmounting, errors, and a bossy warning about removing a drive before unmounting (with the option to disable, of course)
- More robust unmounting process (currently it's just running the umount command and hoping the user has permission to do so)
- Use your default file browser when opening the drive, rather than forcing COSMIC Files

## Installation

A [justfile](./justfile) is included by default for the [casey/just][just] command runner.

- `just` builds the application with the default `just build-release` recipe
- `just run` builds and runs the application
- `just install` installs the project into the system
- `just vendor` creates a vendored tarball
- `just build-vendored` compiles with vendored dependencies from that tarball
- `just check` runs clippy on the project to check for linter warnings
- `just check-json` can be used by IDEs that support LSP

## Translators

[Fluent][fluent] is used for localization of the software. Fluent's translation files are found in the [i18n directory](./i18n). New translations may copy the [English (en) localization](./i18n/en) of the project, rename `en` to the desired [ISO 639-1 language code][iso-codes], and then translations can be provided for each [message identifier][fluent-guide]. If no translation is necessary, the message may be omitted.

## Developers

Developers should install [rustup][rustup] and configure their editor to use [rust-analyzer][rust-analyzer]. To improve compilation times, disable LTO in the release profile, install the [mold][mold] linker, and configure [sccache][sccache] for use with Rust. The [mold][mold] linker will only improve link times if LTO is disabled.
